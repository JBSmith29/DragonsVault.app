  <p>
    We want you to be satisfied with every purchase. This policy describes how returns and refunds are handled for eligible orders.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Return Window</h2>
  <p>
    Physical goods may be returned within 30 days of delivery in their original condition. Digital products, subscriptions, and personalized services are non-refundable unless otherwise stated.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h5 mt-4">How to Request a Return</h2>
  <p>
    Contact us with your order number and reason for return. We will provide instructions and, when applicable, a return shipping label. Items should be securely packaged to avoid damage in transit.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Once a return is received and inspected, refunds are issued to the original payment method within 5–7 business days. Shipping fees are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error.
  </p>
  <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Exchanges</h2>
  <p>
    Exchanges may be offered when inventory allows. Otherwise, a refund will be issued and you can place a new order.
