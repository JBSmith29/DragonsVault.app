  <h1 class="mb-3">About DragonsVault</h1>
  <p>
    DragonsVault is a community-driven tool for organizing and analyzing collectible card decks. Our mission is to provide
    a simple, privacy-conscious platform for managing personal collections, sharing ideas with friends, and learning from data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project started as a hobby among friends who wanted better deck-building utilities and has grown into a collaborative effort.
    We continually refine the app based on user feedback and new features in the Magic community.
